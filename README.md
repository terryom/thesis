MA Thesis
================================

Some code for my MA thesis "Noise Traders or Smart Money? Evidence on Large Participant Behaviour in the Foreign Exchange Futures Market" is compiled in this repository. 

Abstract:
*The exchange rate disconnect puzzle remains one of the great shortcomings of international finance. One potential resolution of this puzzle is that investor heterogeneity is responsible for exchange rate volatility in the short-run. In this thesis I empirically assess a smart money- noise trader model of the exchange rate market by
applying various multivariate statistical methodologies: from standard vector autoregression to the more recent method of vine copula inference. Using data on futures market positions of various categories of investors, I show that there are marked differences in investor behaviour and that certain categories are positively correlated with
futures contract prices. Whether this positive correlation is due to feedback trading or the better information/ market power hypothesis is unclear, though the evidence is balanced in favour of the former.
